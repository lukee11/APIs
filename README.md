The first tool is a personal finance planner that will allow users to see their savings, which will be made up of stock and cryptocurrency assets, in order to determine whether they have enough money set aside for an emergency fund.

The second product will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to retrieve historical closing prices for a stock and bond retirement portfolio, then run Monte Carlo simulations to estimate portfolio performance over various timeframes and project portfolio returns for a particular starting blance.
